Botworld is a cellular automaton developed at [MIRI](http://intelligence.org)
as a concrete environment in which to study self-modifying agents embedded in
their environment. (Contrast this with "classical" models of artificial
intelligence where agents interact with the environment only via I/O channels.)

An extensive introduction to Botworld can be found in the
[Botworld technical report](http://intelligence.org/files/Botworld.pdf).
The source code for Botworld can be found in the corresponding
[literate Haskell file](Botworld.lhs).
